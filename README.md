# Dijkstras-Algorithm
Java implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. This repository provides an efficient solution for calculating the shortest distance between nodes in graphs, offering a fundamental algorithmic tool for pathfinding and network analysis. 

# Overview
Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently computes the shortest path between a specified source node and all other nodes in a graph. This implementation utilizes a priority queue to explore neighboring nodes and update the shortest distances accordingly.

# Features
Graph Representation: Supports a weighted graph structure using adjacency lists.

Efficient Pathfinding: Computes shortest paths from a specified source node to all other nodes in the graph.

User Interaction: Accepts user input for the number of vertices and edges, allowing dynamic graph creation.

# Usage
Input: Run the program and input the number of vertices and edges.

Edge Definitions: Enter the edges with their weights.

Source Node: Specify the source vertex for computing shortest paths.

Output: Displays the shortest distance from the source node to every other node in the graph.
